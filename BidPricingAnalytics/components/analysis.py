                ### What This Analysis Shows
                
                The histograms display the distribution of CPI values for won and lost bids, 
                revealing the price ranges that are most common in each category.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Price Range Comparison**: Won bids typically have a lower CPI range compared to lost bids,
                   indicating that competitive pricing is important for winning projects.
                
                2. **Distribution Shape**: The shape of the distribution provides insights into pricing patterns.
                   A narrower distribution suggests more consistent pricing, while a wider distribution indicates
                   more variable pricing based on project factors.
                
                3. **Overlap Areas**: Where the distributions overlap represents the competitive pricing zone
                   where other factors besides price (such as reputation, capabilities, relationships) may
                   determine bid success.
                
                4. **Pricing Thresholds**: The mean values (vertical dashed lines) can be used as reference
                   points for setting competitive pricing thresholds.

                ### Understanding the IR-CPI Relationship
                
                Incidence Rate (IR) is the percentage of people who qualify for a survey. It has a significant
                impact on CPI because it affects how difficult it is to find qualified respondents.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Inverse Relationship**: As shown in both charts, there's generally an inverse relationship
                   between IR and CPI - as IR increases, CPI tends to decrease. This is logical because higher
                   incidence rates mean less screening effort is needed.
                
                2. **Price Gap by IR Level**: The bar chart reveals that the gap between won and lost CPIs
                   varies across IR bins. This can help identify where competitive pricing sensitivity is highest.
                
                3. **Pricing Strategy**: For lower IR ranges (0-30%), pricing sensitivity appears higher,
                   suggesting that competitive pricing is especially important for low-IR projects.
                
                4. **Diminishing Returns**: The benefit of higher IR on CPI appears to flatten above certain
                   IR thresholds, suggesting that very high IR doesn't necessarily enable proportionally lower pricing.

                ### Understanding the LOI-CPI Relationship
                
                Length of Interview (LOI) is the duration of the survey in minutes. It directly affects
                respondent compensation and therefore influences the overall CPI.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Positive Correlation**: Both charts show a clear positive correlation between LOI and CPI.
                   As surveys get longer, prices increase to compensate respondents for their time.
                
                2. **Pricing Slope**: The trend lines in the scatter plot show how CPI typically increases with
                   each additional minute of survey length. This can be used as a guideline for pricing adjustment.
                
                3. **Won vs. Lost Comparison**: The gap between won and lost bids widens as LOI increases,
                   suggesting that competitive pricing becomes even more critical for longer surveys.
                
                4. **Pricing Thresholds**: The bar chart reveals clear pricing thresholds for different LOI bins,
                   which can serve as benchmarks when pricing new projects.

                ### Understanding the Sample Size-CPI Relationship
                
                Sample size (number of completes) affects CPI through economies of scale - larger projects
                typically have lower per-unit costs due to volume efficiencies.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Negative Correlation**: Both charts show that as sample size increases, CPI tends to decrease,
                   following a logarithmic curve (diminishing returns). This reflects standard volume discount practices.
                
                2. **Volume Discount Thresholds**: The bar chart reveals clear pricing thresholds at different
                   sample size bins, providing guidance on appropriate volume discount levels.
                
                3. **Won vs. Lost Comparison**: The gap between won and lost bids changes across sample size bins,
                   suggesting different pricing sensitivities at different volumes.
                
                4. **Large Sample Competitiveness**: The competitive gap appears larger for very large samples,
                   indicating that pricing competitiveness may be especially important for high-volume projects.

                ### Understanding Multi-Factor Effects on CPI
                
                The heatmaps visualize how IR and LOI jointly influence CPI, revealing complex patterns
                that might not be evident when examining each factor in isolation.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Interaction Effect**: The heatmaps show that IR and LOI interact to influence CPI.
                   For example, the impact of low IR is more pronounced for longer surveys, creating
                   a compound effect on pricing.
                
                2. **Pricing Hot Spots**: Dark areas in the won/lost heatmaps indicate combinations of IR and LOI
                   that command higher prices, helping identify premium pricing opportunities.
                
                3. **Competitive Gaps**: The differential heatmap reveals where the largest pricing gaps exist
                   between won and lost bids, highlighting where pricing adjustments might have the biggest impact.
                
                4. **Optimal Pricing Zones**: Areas with smaller differentials represent zones where won and lost
                   bids have similar pricing, suggesting highly competitive price points.

                ### Understanding 3D Relationships
                
                The 3D scatter plot visualizes the combined effect of IR, LOI, and sample size (represented by
                marker size) on total project cost, providing a holistic view of how these factors interact.
                
                ### Key Insights
                
                1. **Complex Relationships**: The 3D plot reveals that project costs are influenced by the
                   interaction of multiple factors, not just individual variables in isolation.
                
                2. **Scale Effect**: Marker sizes represent sample sizes, showing how larger projects (bigger
                   markers) relate to other factors - revealing that high-cost projects often have lower IRs
                   and higher LOIs.
                
                3. **Won vs. Lost Clustering**: The spatial distribution of won vs. lost bids in the 3D space
                   reveals pricing patterns and competitive thresholds across different combinations of factors.
                
                4. **Total Cost Perspective**: While CPI is important, this view brings focus to total project
                   cost, which is ultimately what matters for budget decisions and overall competitiveness.
